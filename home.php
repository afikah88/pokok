            <p>The forestry system project leverages advanced technology 
                to enhance sustainable forest management (SFM) for 
                timber production in Malaysia. By integrating programs 
                for data generation, calculation, tree mapping, and analysis, 
                the system aims to assist the forest department of tropical 
                countries to manage their forests for timber production sustainably. 
                It supports efficient resource utilization and the preservation of 
                forest ecosystems through data-driven insights and user-friendly features.</p>
